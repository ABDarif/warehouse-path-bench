# Legends Fix - Research Assistant Feedback

## ❌ **Issue Identified:**
> "planning time vs success rate graph that there are no proper legends about what refers to what"

## ✅ **Fixes Implemented:**

### **1. Created New Planning Time vs Success Rate Plot**
- **New Function**: `plot_planning_vs_success_rate()` in `viz/plots.py`
- **Clear Legends**: Each algorithm has distinct color and marker
- **Detailed Annotations**: Shows algorithm name and exact values
- **Professional Styling**: Larger figure size, clear fonts, proper spacing

### **2. Enhanced Existing Planning Time vs Optimization Rate Plot**
- **Improved Legends**: Added distinct markers for each algorithm
- **Clear Annotations**: Algorithm names with exact values in boxes
- **Better Styling**: Larger size, professional appearance
- **Legend Title**: Added "Algorithms" title for clarity

### **3. Legend Features Added:**
- **Distinct Colors**: Each algorithm gets unique color from Set1 colormap
- **Unique Markers**: Different shapes (circle, square, triangle, diamond, etc.)
- **Clear Labels**: Algorithm names clearly displayed in legend
- **Value Annotations**: Exact planning time and success/optimization rate values
- **Professional Layout**: Legend positioned outside plot area with proper spacing

## 📊 **Generated Plots:**

1. **`planning_time_vs_opt.png`** - Planning Time vs Optimization Rate
   - ✅ Clear legends with algorithm names
   - ✅ Distinct markers and colors
   - ✅ Value annotations for each point

2. **`planning_time_vs_success_rate.png`** - Planning Time vs Success Rate (NEW)
   - ✅ Proper legends showing what each point represents
   - ✅ Success rate from 0 to 1.1 scale
   - ✅ Perfect success line at 100%
   - ✅ Clear algorithm identification

3. **`optimization_rate.png`** - Bar chart with values
4. **`full_planning_time_vs_opt.png`** - Full planning time including replanning

## 🎯 **Legend Improvements:**

### **Before (Issues):**
- ❌ Generic labels like "A* Planner"
- ❌ No clear algorithm identification
- ❌ Missing value annotations
- ❌ Poor visual distinction

### **After (Fixed):**
- ✅ **Algorithm Names**: "HeldKarp", "NN2opt", "GA", "ACO", "ALO", "HybridNN2opt"
- ✅ **Distinct Markers**: Circle, Square, Triangle, Diamond, etc.
- ✅ **Unique Colors**: Each algorithm has different color
- ✅ **Value Annotations**: Shows exact (planning_time, success_rate) values
- ✅ **Professional Legend**: Positioned outside plot with title
- ✅ **Clear Identification**: Easy to understand what each point represents

## 📈 **Visual Improvements:**

- **Figure Size**: Increased to 10x6 for better readability
- **Font Sizes**: Larger fonts for titles and labels
- **Grid Lines**: Dashed grid for better data reading
- **Borders**: Black borders around markers for clarity
- **Annotations**: Colored boxes with exact values
- **Legend Position**: Outside plot area to avoid overlap

## 🚀 **Result:**
The Research Assistant can now clearly see:
- **What each point represents** (algorithm name)
- **Exact values** for planning time and success rate
- **Visual distinction** between different algorithms
- **Professional presentation** suitable for thesis submission

The legends issue is completely resolved! 🎉
